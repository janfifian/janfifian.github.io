## Webpage Visualisation Tools

Here we provide access to webpage Visualisation Tools, which generate the initial and resulting schedule for the flights based on the provided data files. The visualisation tools do not access or utilize the solver directly, rather they work with the output files generated by the solver.

#### Dependencies

We use day.js for data processing, PapaParse for parsing input and Plotly for the visualisation itself.
