        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>NT-proBNP as a promising biomarker for sarcopenia:</strong>
                A statistically significant elevation of NT-proBNP concentrations was observed in patients
                with sarcopenia (1060.5 pg/ml) compared with the control group (572.8 pg/ml)
                (p = 0.02), confirming an association between this marker and sarcopenia.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Limitations of current screening:</strong>
                The recommended SARC-F questionnaire shows low sensitivity
                (0.50 in the overall study population; 0.0 in the subgroup without frailty),
                underscoring its inefficiency in early identification of sarcopenia risk.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>SRTSI – a new index with high diagnostic accuracy:</strong>
                A new simplified index, SRTSI (Simplified Rapid Test for Sarcopenia Screening Indications),
                was developed based on NT-proBNP, creatinine concentration (Cr), and BMI.
                SRTSI demonstrated very good diagnostic performance in the full cohort (AUC = 0.82),
                reaching AUC = 0.87 in the subgroup without heart or kidney failure.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Higher clinical sensitivity:</strong>
                The proposed cut-off of SRTSI ≥ 1 for the general population is characterized
                by a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.75.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Practical simplicity:</strong>
                SRTSI is an easy-to-use tool relying on widely accessible biochemical measurements
                (NT-proBNP, creatinine, BMI), enabling rapid incorporation into general-practice (GP)
                settings to accelerate sarcopenia diagnostics.
